    <div>
        (This is div)
        <span>***This is span***</span>
        and this is more writing and in the same line with span.
    </div>

    <div>
        But this is also more writing but it starts in another line. Because It is another div.
        And we know that div is a block-level element and span in inline element.
        (This is div2)
        <span>***This is span 2***</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        (This is div3)
        <span>***This is span 3***</span>
    </div>
</body>
